Our aim for this project is to make a movie application that lets users post about their opinions about
the movies they have watched and  experiences about the movie theater that they have seen the movie
in. In our application, users  will be able to add locations of those movie theaters to their post using
geotagging technologies like Google Maps. Our application will provide users to have a chance to meet
with people that share common interests in movies/movie genres.
